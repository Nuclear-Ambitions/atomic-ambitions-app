## Development Notes

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that leverages Tailwind CSS for styling.

We are using npm. To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Cloudflare Hosting

We are hosting as a Cloudflare Worker, which is preferred over Pages.

This works from my laptop.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Still trying to get auto-builds to work.
